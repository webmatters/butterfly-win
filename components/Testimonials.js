Before seeing Valerie, I was able to work on my mindset and know things intellectually but I was still struggling, so I knew the blocks and areas that needed help were on the subconscious and energetic               level. Valerie helps me clear these blocks so I can fully integrate and be whole and free from all the junk holding me back. I now have a sense of calm, groundedness, and success that Iâ€™ve never experienced before in my life.',

Not only did I learn specific skills to incorporate into my massage practice, I also benefited from the work as we practiced during class. I am better for attending, body, mind and spirit and will take more classes from her.',

I can't say enough about how much our sessions have truly impacted my life for the better!",
